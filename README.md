# Awesome LinkedIn Tools
Hey friends and thanks for the great feedback so far. As promised, I will publish the first script for fighting recruiter spam with a little magic 🎩🦄
of JavaScript ES6 and sneaking into the devtools.

## 💞💞💞💞 Sharing is caring 🙌🙌🙌

So I created a little [patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/join/sourcewars?) and if you like you could donate a little bit of your bucks. All the money will be collected and donated over to an NPO (non-profit-organization/charity) to help other people. So code should always do good things to the people. 👏👏 We will make a vote together where we would like to donate the collected money! 👏👏

## How to use ? ⛑️
To execute the script you need to visit your LinkedIn profile, visiting your [My Network](https://www.linkedin.com/mynetwork/) area and click on [Manage all](https://www.linkedin.com/mynetwork/invitation-manager/) in the upper right corner. Then you need to open up your JavaScript console, pasting in the snippet and press <kbd>ENTER ⏎</kbd> ☑️

*Here are the shortcuts for WIN ⏳😜/OSX 🍏/LINUX 🐧 to open up the console window.*

| OS | Chrome 👓 | Safari 🦁🐘 | Firefox  🔥🦊 |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| OSX 🍏 | <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Opt ⌥</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd>  | <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Opt ⌥</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> | <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Opt ⌥</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> |
| WIN ⏳😜| <kbd>CTRL ⌃</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT ⇧</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> |  can't find it in the docs 🤯| <kbd>CTRL ⌃</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT ⇧</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd>  |
| LINUX 🐧 | <kbd>CTRL ⌃</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT ⇧</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> | can't find it in the docs 🤯 | <kbd>CTRL ⌃</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT ⇧</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> |

***HINT**: for accessing the devtools inside safari, first you need to enable it inside your preferences. Goto >> Safari >> Advanced >> ✅ Show Develop menu in menu bar.*

And this is the way how it should work.
